;[Name]

; How long emitter will live
;EmitterLife

; Name of the particle which emitter will genereate
;Particle

; Shape of the emitter
;Shape=Point | Circle | Line

; This is the shape parameters 
;ShapeVars

; If your shape is:
;	POINT: No Shape Vars
;	CIRCLE: Radius (1 var)
;	LINE:   2xVector2 (4 vars)

; This value means that X and Y velocity will be randomly genereated from eg. -20 to 20 and 10 to 30
;VelocityX=-20,20
;VelocityY=10,30

; NOT USED AT THIS TIME
;LifeSpanFactor=1.0f

; Time between new particles
;TimeStep=0.0001f

; How many new particles should be generated on update
;NewParticle=4

; This function creates new emitter
