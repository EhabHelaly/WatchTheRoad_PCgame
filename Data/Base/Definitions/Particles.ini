; Defines textures tile for particle face
; Each particle has random tile
; You can define as many tiles for particles as you want
; All tile faces needs to be on the same texture. So you can't define tile faces from two diffrent textures

; EXTRA NOTE
; For performance reasons I recommend to put all particle tile faces into one texture
; If texture is to small don't be affraid to extend it.
