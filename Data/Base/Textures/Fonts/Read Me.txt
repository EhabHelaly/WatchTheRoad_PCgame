Angel Bitmap Font Settings:
- Export font as 'Unicode' (it should work in ANSI mode)
- Set 'Equalize the cell heigths' because Lavgine use fixed line rendering (use more texture space but it is still faster)
- Bit depth: 32 bits
- Chanells:
	Alpha: Encoded glyph & outline
	RGB: glyph
- Use 'Text' format and 'PNG' images
- Try to fit all characters into one 'Texture'
- Don't use too many Unicode characters in one font
- Use basic and one language specific letters
- Kernings are not required (They are disabled anyways).
